# MongoDB Aggregation Bug: Inconsistent Joining Field

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a MongoDB aggregation pipeline using `$lookup` and `unwind`. The issue arises when the joining field (`id` in this case) isn't consistently present in both collections.  This can result in unexpected results or errors.

## Problem

The `$lookup` stage successfully joins documents, but if the `foreignField`  (`id`) is missing in some documents in `collectionB`, the subsequent `$unwind` stage can produce unexpected results. It may unexpectedly remove documents that should be retained, leading to data loss or inconsistency.

## Solution

The solution involves adding a conditional check within the pipeline to filter out documents with missing `id` values before `$unwind` is applied, preventing unexpected document removal. This ensures that only valid matches are processed during the unwinding stage, leading to accurate results.

## How to reproduce

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running.
3.  Set up the MongoDB collections ('collectionA' and 'collectionB') as defined in `bug.js`.
4.  Run `bug.js` to observe the unexpected behavior.
5.  Run `bugSolution.js` to see the corrected aggregation pipeline.
